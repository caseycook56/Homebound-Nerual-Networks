# Homebound: Nerual Networks
This is an implementatio of the survival game homebound found under Homebound: AI but using nerual networks with teh package ML Agents

The point of this was to train the dwarves to survive goblins killing them given a certain map.
I set up the nerual netwrok to have the poisition of itself being the current dwarf and then the position off all the goblins on the map and the end point.
I found that that this was the best implmentation and after leveling it run for 4 million steps it won every single time
